FFT Analysis Application
Overview
This application provides a comprehensive analysis of signal processing through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithms. It visualizes sine waves, composite waves, and their amplitude and phase spectrums.

Features
Generate and visualize individual sine waves with adjustable parameters (frequency, amplitude, decay, phase).
Create and display composite waves from multiple sine waves.
Analyze and illustrate amplitude and phase spectrums using FFT.
Interactive UI with real-time graph updates.
Technologies Used
React
Material-UI
Recharts
